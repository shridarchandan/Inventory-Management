1. Authentication & Authorization
User accounts
Sign up, login, logout.
Password reset (email/OTP link) and change password.
Security
Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2).
JWT-based auth (access + refresh tokens) or HTTP-only session cookies.
Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)
Roles: Admin, Manager, Staff, Viewer.
Route guards in Express and protected routes in React.
Permissions examples:
Admin: manage users, roles, all entities and settings.
Manager: full CRUD on stock, POs/SOs, reports, but no user management.
Staff: limited CRUD (e.g., only create/edit orders, no delete).
Viewer: read‑only dashboards and reports.
Audit logs
Table like audit_logs(user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, before, after, timestamp).
Show recent activity in an admin “Activity” page.
2. Extended Data Model & Inventory Workflows
New entities
Warehouse (locations) with per‑warehouse stock.
Customer.
PurchaseOrder / PurchaseOrderItem.
SalesOrder / SalesOrderItem.
StockMovement (every stock in/out event: PO receive, SO ship, adjustment, transfer).
Inventory behavior
Automatic stock updates via StockMovement instead of directly editing products.quantity.
Reorder points & safety stock per product (by warehouse).
Low‑stock and out‑of‑stock flags.
Optional batch/lot + expiry tracking (batches table) for products.
Workflows
Purchase flow: create PO → set status (Draft → Ordered → Received → Closed) → receive items updates stock.
Sales flow: create SO → Reserve → Shipped → Closed, with optional “Cancelled” status.
Stock transfer: move quantity from one warehouse to another (two StockMovement records).
Stock adjustment: manual corrections with reason codes (damage, shrinkage, audit correction).
3. Advanced Product Management
Richer product fields
Multiple images (you already have image support; extend it to gallery + cover image).
SKU, barcode, brand, tags, min/max levels, tax rate.
Active/inactive, discontinued flags.
Variants
Parent product with variant attributes (size, color, etc.).
Separate product_variants table referencing products and holding stock per variant.
Batch/expiry
For perishable products: batch_no, mfg_date, exp_date, quantity.
Automatic “near expiry” and “expired” reports.
4. Frontend UI/UX (React)
Auth UI
Login/register forms with validation and error display.
Persistent auth (token in memory + refresh or cookies).
Protected routes and role‑aware navigation/menu (hide/show options).
Entity management screens
CRUD pages for:
Users & roles (Admin only).
Warehouses, customers, products, categories, suppliers.
Purchase orders, sales orders, stock movements.
Features:
Search, filters (by category, supplier, date), sorting.
Pagination.
Inline edits for common fields (e.g., price, quantity).
Dashboards
High‑level cards: total stock value, number of products, low‑stock count, pending POs/SOs.
Charts: monthly purchases vs sales, stock value trend, top products, top suppliers/customers.
Tables: low‑stock items, near‑expiry batches, recent movements.
Nice UX
Toast notifications for success/error.
Loading skeletons/spinners.
Confirmation dialogs on destructive actions.
Modern styling and responsive layout; optional dark mode toggle.
5. Reporting & Exports
Reports
Current stock by product & warehouse.
Stock movement history for a product or warehouse (date‑filterable).

Expiry/near‑expiry and batch reports.
Exports

Printable views for:
Purchase orders.
Sales orders/invoices.
Delivery notes / packing lists.
6. Integrations & Utilities (still app‑level)
Email notifications (app feature, no infra config)
Hooks in business logic to send:
Low stock alerts.
PO status changes.
Near‑expiry batch alerts.
Barcode/QR support
Store barcode per product; render barcode/QR in UI.
Search product by scanning (scanner acts as keyboard input).
Bulk import tools

Products, suppliers, customers, initial stock.
Validation and preview before committing.
